👋 Hello, I'm Alfath Muqoddas!

How you doin? Welcome to my github repo, feel free to check out my repo collection!

I'm mainly a front-end web developer, been dealing with many front-end frameworks, but professionally I'm a reactjs dev.

I also have some interest with backend framework, like Laravel, Expressjs, and currently Spring Boot. I've built some restful web api with those framework, please check out some of my repo.

My passion in programming began with my interest in Linux. So I have this personal connection with Linux. I've distro-hopped on many distros like Debian, Arch, Fedora, you name it. I have some repo if you interested in ricing your distro's look and feel. I got some scripts to automate your linux distro deployment in virtual environment, please check it out!

I have experience in setting up some cloud environment for a web app deployment like Google Cloud Compute Engine, Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine, Google Clound VPC Network, Google Cloud Object Storage and RedHat Openshift.

I've built some front-end web applications for a big company, which went into some rigorous testing process and subsequently went live. Yeah been there.

Feel free to connect! If there's some questions or business inquiries, you can contact me. I believe I have adequeate experinces to address your needs.
