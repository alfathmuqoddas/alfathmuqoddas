# 👋 Hello, I'm Alfath Muqoddas!

✨How you doin? Welcome to my github repo, feel free to check out my repo collection!✨

💻 I'm mainly a front-end web developer, been dealing with many front-end frameworks, but professionally I'm a reactjs dev.

🔧 I also have some interest with backend framework, like Laravel, Expressjs, and currently Spring Boot. I've built some restful web api with those framework, please check out some of my repo.

🐧 My passion in programming began with my interest in Linux. So I have this personal connection with Linux. I've distro-hopped on many distros like Debian, Arch, Fedora, you name it. I have some repo if you interested in ricing your distro's look and feel. I got some scripts to automate your linux distro deployment in virtual environment, please check it out!

☁️ I have experience in setting up some cloud environment for a web app deployment like Google Cloud Compute Engine, Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine, Google Clound VPC Network, Google Cloud Object Storage and RedHat Openshift.

⚡ I've built some front-end web applications for a big company, which went into some rigorous testing process and subsequently went live. Yeah been there.

📧 Feel free to connect! You can contact me for any questions or business inquiries. I believe I have adequeate experinces to address your needs.
