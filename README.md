# 👋 Hello, I'm Alfath Muqoddas!

✨How you doin? Welcome to my github repo, feel free to check out my repo collection!✨

💻 I'm mainly a front-end web developer, been dealing with many front-end frameworks, but professionally I'm a reactjs dev.

🔧 I also have an interest in backend frameworks, like Laravel, Expressjs, and currently Spring Boot. I've built some RESTful web api with those frameworks, please check out some of my repos.

🐧 My passion for programming began with my interest in Linux. I have a strong personal connection with Linux and have experimented with numerous distros like Debian, Arch, Fedora, you name it. I have some repos if you interested in ricing your distro's look and feel. I got some scripts to automate your linux distro deployment in virtual environment, please check it out!

☁️ I have experience in setting up some cloud environments for web app deployments like Google Cloud Compute Engine, Google Cloud Kubernetes Engine, Google Clound VPC Network, Google Cloud Object Storage, RedHat Openshift, etc.

⚡ I've developed some front-end web applications for a large company, which underwent rigorous testing process and subsequently deployed into production. So I have some experiences in that arena.

📧 Feel free to connect! You can contact me for any questions or business inquiries. I believe I have adequeate experinces to address your needs.
